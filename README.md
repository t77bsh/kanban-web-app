# The journey:

Over the past month, I embarked on an exciting journey to create a Kanban web app as part of a portfolio project. Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of Kanban boards, I aimed to create a digital version that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. In this blog post, I will share my experiences, the tech stack I used, the challenges I encountered, and the valuable lessons I learned during this process.

The tech stack for this project was carefully chosen to provide a smooth and seamless user experience. I used React JS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux, React-beautiful-DnD, Node, Express, MongoDB and Firebase.

### Challenges:

One of the core features of the app is the ability to drag and drop tasks across columns. Implementing this was challenging, the native HTML5 Drag & Drop API lacked the behaviour I required, but react-beautiful-dnd provided an elegant solution. It allowed me to create a seamless and accessible drag-and-drop interface without much hassle and achieve the desired behavior for an optimal user experience.

Managing the state of the application was another significant challenge. As the app grew in complexity, it became crucial to keep the state organized and easy to maintain. Initially, I tried to use React's built-in Context API for state management. However, it fell short in handling the increasing complexity with state in non-hierarchical component structures that did not share a parent-child-like relation. Redux proved to be an excellent  solution for this. It enabled me to manage the global state of the app effectively, making it easier to add new features and track changes while providing a more streamlined way to share state between unrelated components.

Implementing secure user authentication was essential to ensure the privacy and safety of user data. Firebase provided a reliable and straightforward solution for handling user authentication. With its built-in authentication features and third-party Single Sign-On (SSO) options, I was able to quickly set up a robust sign-up and sign-in process.

Choosing the right database for storing boards data was crucial. MongoDB, with its flexible schema structure and high performance, turned out to be the perfect choice. By using Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, I was able to create and manage board schemas easily and create intricate sub-schemas that allowed for storage of task details and subtasks, ensuring data consistency throughout the app. 


##Â Takeaways and Learnings

This month-long journey of building a Kanban web app has been an incredible learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

Choose the right tools: Picking the right tech stack and libraries can significantly impact the development process. By using tools that are well-suited for the task at hand, I was able to save time and effort.

Plan and organize: A well-structured plan and organization is essential for managing complex projects. Breaking down the project by features and setting realistic deadlines helped me stay on track.

Be prepared for challenges: Encountering challenges is inevitable when building a web app. Being open to learning from them and finding solutions is crucial for growth as a developer.

Embrace collaboration: Engaging with the developer community, seeking advice, and sharing knowledge can lead to better solutions and a more enjoyable development experience.

## Thoughts

Building a Kanban web app from scratch has been an enriching and rewarding journey. Not only did I learn new skills and technologies, but I also gained a deeper understanding of the development process and the importance of overcoming challenges. I'm proud of the final product and look forward to applying these learnings to future projects.
